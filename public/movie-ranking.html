    <li><b>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)</b></li>
    <p>The reason why this movie is my all time favorite movie is never give up in life and try dedicate your life to your job. The movie inspired me to start doing something now, no matter what how fear you have or how risk everything is. At least, you are brave enough to do it. I love the location that they filmed in Iceland too, it makes me feel fresh and alive, I want to go there one day.</p>
